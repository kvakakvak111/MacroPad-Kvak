**Inspiration:**

    My Friend showed me his MacroPad and i was amazed. I wanted to make my own and beeter one :) 

**Challenges**

    Making the PCB in KiCAD was extremly dificult for me. I never used to work with these. But it was pretty fun when I got into it. Modeling the case was pretty okey, i followed the guide on blueprint.hackclub.com and made a good case. Maybe I will edit the case later.

**BOM:**

    9x Cherry MX switches
    9x blank DSA keycaps
    1x Seeed XIAO RP2040 (THT)
    1x PCB
    4x M3 x 7mm screws

    Others:
    KMK firmware
    Top and Bottom step file of Case.
